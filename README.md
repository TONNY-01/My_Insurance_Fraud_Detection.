## Overview

This project is dedicated to detecting fraudulent insurance claims using supervised machine learning. By analyzing historical claim data, the project aims to flag suspicious claims early, allowing for timely investigation and intervention.

## Problem Statement

Insurance companies face financial losses due to fraudulent claims which drive up the cost for honest policyholders. The goal here is to build a robust fraud detection system that:
- Distinguishes between legitimate and fraudulent claims.
- Reduces false positives to ensure that genuine claims are processed without unnecessary delays.
- Improves the overall efficiency and reliability of claim assessments.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project consists of historical insurance claims with various features such as:
- **Claim Details:** Amount, type, and descriptions.
- **Customer Information:** Demographics and policy details.
- **Incident Characteristics:** Date, location, and circumstances of the claim.

Preprocessing steps include cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and performing normalization where needed.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cleaning and imputing missing values.
   - Encoding categorical features using tools like `LabelEncoder`.
   - Applying scaling and normalization techniques.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Creating new features based on domain knowledge.
   - Selecting the most informative features through correlation analysis and feature importance metrics.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**  
   - Experimenting with various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Evaluating models using cross-validation and performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC).

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Analyzing model performance with confusion matrices and other evaluation tools.
   - Fine-tuning parameters to improve predictive accuracy.
